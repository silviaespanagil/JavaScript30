# Vanilla Javascript Challenge
## _30 days - 30 proyects_

¡Hola!

I've been learning some Javascript and was looking for proyects to practice until I stumbled on the #javascript30 challenge✨

[30 day vanilla JS coding challenge](https://javascript30.com/) which also comes with tutorials so you never get stuck. I'll be updating this readme almost daily with a little personal review of each challenge and my take of it. 


### Day one: Drumkit 🥁 

The challengue was to develop a drum kit in which if you press a key on your keyboard a sound is made. I wanted to change it a little bit and decided to make it as a  kid app where each letter represents an animal with that letter so when the mini user 👧 select the kid an animal sound will be played.

If a key is selected the corresponding card will be  highligthed until the sound finishes.

### Day two: A clock 🕑 

Well, this is pretty self explanatory but we were ask develop a clock with an hour, minute and second hand. This exercise I was not able to do it without the tutoria, mainly because of the math behind 🧮(lol) and because  of a CSS property I had never worked before: transform-origin. This property allow you to move the center of gravity of an element so that if you transform it like I did with the rotation property it will rotate not from the center but from one of the ends.

As always I did a mini gif so you can check it out without runing the proyect, I promise, it runs hours, minutes and seconds by the clock <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81619759/120921576-9aec5000-c6c4-11eb-81cb-2ea4b8579124.gif" height="250"/>
