# Vanilla Javascript Challenge
## _30 days - 30 proyects_

¡Hola!

I've been learning some Javascript and was looking for proyects to practice until I stumbled on the #javascript30 challenge✨

[30 day vanilla JS coding challenge](https://javascript30.com/) which also comes with tutorials so you never get stuck. I'll be updating this readme almost daily with a little personal review of each challenge and my take of it. 


## Day one 📅

The challengue was to develop a drum kit in which if you press a key on your keyboard a sound is made. I wanted to change it a little bit and decided to make it as a  kid app where each letter represents an animal with that letter so when the mini user 👧 select the kid an animal sound will be played.

If a key is selected the corresponding card will be  highligthed until the sound finishes.
